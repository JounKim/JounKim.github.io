<h1>Geodesic Dome </h1>

recreating the 'honey sphere' with grasshopper.
I thought it would be easy since it is a geodesic dome, and I thought grasshopper had its own geodesic dome component.
However I found out this geodesic dome had its unique rules.

This made me study the origin of the geodesic dome and challenge to make a system to make a geodesic dome.
